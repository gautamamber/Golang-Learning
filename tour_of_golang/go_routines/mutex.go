// We've seen how channels are great for communication among goroutines.

// // But what if we don't need communication? What if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts? 

// This concept is called mutual exclusion, and the conventional name for the data structure that provides it is mutex. 

// Go's standard library provides mutual exclusion with sync.Mutex and its two methods:

// Lock
// Unlock
