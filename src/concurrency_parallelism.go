// Concurrency:
// 1. The composition of independently executing tasks
// 2. Applied when dealing with lots of things at once
// 3. The focus is on how to structure a solution to solve a problem (which may or may not be solved in a parallel manner)

// Parallelism

// 1. Parallelism is the simultaneous execution of computations
// 2. Its all about doing lots of things at once
